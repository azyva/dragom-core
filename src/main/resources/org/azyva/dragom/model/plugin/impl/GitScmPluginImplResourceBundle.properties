WARNING_MERGE_CONFLICTS=\
  WARNING: Conflicts were encoutered during the merge of version {1} into version {2} within the workspace directory {0}.\n\
  This merge is performed using multiple distinct patches because some commits are excluded.\n\
  The dragom-patch-##.patch files are still in the root of the module workspace directory.\n\
  The conflicts occurred while merging the dragom-patch-##.patch.current file and the merge process has not been aborted.\n\
  Please resolve these conflicts and apply the remaining dragom-patch-##.patch files in sequence with "git apply --3way <patch file>", resolving any other conflicts that may be encountered.\n\
  Finally, complete the merge with "git commit" and delete the dragom-patch-##.patch files.\n\
  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT that the merge operation not be completed before resolving the conflicts and applying the remaining patch files.\n\
  If it is, the merge commit will tell Git that the merge is complete, whereas unmerged changes probably exist.

WARNING_UNPUSHED_COMMITS=\
  WARNING: Verification for unsynchronized local changes in {0} has just been performed.\n\
  No uncommitted local changes were discovered. However, the local repository contains unpushed commits which cannot be considered as uncommitted local changes since there is nothing to commit.\n\
  Continuing as if no unsynchronized local changes were found. Be careful not to loose the unpushed commits.
