  The existing static version {1} is considered equivalent to the ModuleVersion {0}, but this is following a sequence of Dragom-introduced commits that only change versions and result in a state that is equivalent to this earlier static version.\n\
  These version-changing commits may have been recently introduced, cannot be removed and will remain on the original ModuleVersion.
