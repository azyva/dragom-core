# At least one child reference was processed so parent needs to be processed.
# Arguments:
# - ReferencePath of parent
PROCESS_PARENT_BECAUSE_REFERENCE_PROCESSED=At least one reference within ReferencePath {0} was processed (and maybe switched). We must process the parent, potentially switching its version to a new dynamic version.

# Current ModuleVersion switched to new Version which may have different
# references which need to be reviewed, and previous actions will be reapplied.
# - ModuleVersion
# - New Version
REVIEW_CHANGES_TO_REAPPLY_TO_NEW_PARENT_VERSION=The current ModuleVersion {0} was switched to version {1}. Here is a summary of the reference differences and actions that will be automatically reapplied to the new versions based on what was already processed:

# Reference in new Version corresponding to reference in original Version not
# found.
# Arguments:
# - Original reference
REFERENCE_IN_NEW_VERSION_NOT_FOUND=\
  Original reference: {0}\n\
  No corresponding reference found in new version. The processing that may have been performed will not be reapplied.

# New reference Version found in new Version and original reference was not
# processed.
# Arguments:
# - Original reference
# - New reference
NEW_REFERENCE_VERSION_ORG_NOT_PROCESSED=\
  Original reference: {0} (not processed).\n\
  Corresponding reference in new version: {1} (different version).\n\
  Original reference with the new different version may be processed. It will therefore be visited again.

# New reference Version found in new Version, original was processed but not
# switched, and new version is as established.
# Arguments:
# - Original reference
# - New reference
# - Established Version (same as in new reference)
NEW_REFERENCE_VERSION_ORG_PROCESSED_NOT_SWITCHED_NEW_SAME_AS_ESTABLISHED=\
  Original reference: {0} (processed but not switched).\n\
  Corresponding reference in new version: {1} (different version from original, but same as previously established for module).\n\
  The new established version will be kept for this reference.

# New reference Version found in new Version, original was processed but not
# switched, and new version is different.
# Arguments:
# - Original reference
# - New reference
# - Established Version
NEW_REFERENCE_VERSION_ORG_PROCESSED_NOT_SWITCHED=\
  Original reference: {0} (processed but not switched).\n\
  Corresponding reference in new version: {1} (different version).\n\
  The version will be changed to the previously established version {2} for the module.

# New reference Version found in new Version, original was switched, and new
# version is as established.
# Arguments:
# - Original reference
# - New reference
# - Established Version (same as in new reference)
NEW_REFERENCE_VERSION_ORG_SWITCHED_NEW_SAME_AS_ESTABLISHED=\
  Original reference: {0} (switched to {2}).\n\
  Corresponding reference in new version: {1} (different version from original, but same as established for module).\n\
  The new established version will be kept for this reference.

# New reference Version found in new Version, original switched, and new
# version is different.
# Arguments:
# - Original reference
# - New reference
# - Established Version
NEW_REFERENCE_VERSION_ORG_SWITCHED=\
  Original reference: {0} (switched to {2}).\n\
  Corresponding reference in new version: {1} (different version).\n\
  The version will be changed to the established version {2} for the module.

# Reference in original Version corresponding to reference in new Version not
# found.
# Arguments:
# - New reference
REFERENCE_IN_ORG_VERSION_NOT_FOUND=\
  New reference: {0}\n\
  No corresponding reference found in original version. It will therefore be visited.


# No references in the differences were found.
# Arguments: none.
NO_REFERENCE_DIFFERENCES=No differences in the references were found.







This ModuleVersion is already checked out in " + pathModuleWorkspace + ". The change will be performed in this directory.

# Child reference changed and needs updating in parent.
# Arguments:
# - ReferencePath of parent
# - Reference of child
# - New Version
UPDATE_PARENT_BECAUSE_REFERENCE_CHANGED=The version of the reference {1} within ReferencePath {0} was established at {2} during its visit. We must update the parent.
