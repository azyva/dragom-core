# At least one reference was processed so parent needs to be processed.
# Arguments:
# - ReferencePath of parent
PROCESS_PARENT_BECAUSE_REFERENCE_PROCESSED=At least one reference within ReferencePath {0} was processed (and maybe switched). We must process the parent, potentially switching its version to a new dynamic version.

# Current ModuleVersion switched to new Version which may have different
# references which need to be reviewed, and previous actions will be reapplied.
# - ModuleVersion
# - New Version
REVIEW_CHANGES_TO_REAPPLY_TO_NEW_PARENT_VERSION=Current ModuleVersion {0} was switched to version {1}. Here is a summary of the reference differences and actions that will be automatically reapplied to the new versions based on what was already processed:

# Reference in new Version corresponding to reference in original Version not
# found.
# Arguments:
# - Original reference
REFERENCE_IN_NEW_VERSION_NOT_FOUND=\
  Original reference: {0}\n\
  No corresponding reference found in new version. The processing that may have been performed will not be reapplied.

# New reference Version found in new Version and original reference was not
# processed.
# Arguments:
# - Original reference
# - New reference
NEW_REFERENCE_VERSION_ORG_NOT_PROCESSED=\
  Original reference: {0} (not processed).\n\
  Corresponding reference in new version: {1} (different version).\n\
  Original reference with the new different version may be processed. It will therefore be visited again.

# New reference Version found in new Version, original was processed but not
# switched, and new version is as established.
# Arguments:
# - Original reference
# - New reference
# - Established Version (same as in new reference)
NEW_REFERENCE_VERSION_ORG_PROCESSED_NOT_SWITCHED_NEW_SAME_AS_ESTABLISHED=\
  Original reference: {0} (processed but not switched).\n\
  Corresponding reference in new version: {1} (different version from original, but same as previously established for module).\n\
  The new established version will be kept for this reference.

# New reference Version found in new Version, original was processed but not
# switched, and new version is different.
# Arguments:
# - Original reference
# - New reference
# - Established Version
NEW_REFERENCE_VERSION_ORG_PROCESSED_NOT_SWITCHED=\
  Original reference: {0} (processed but not switched).\n\
  Corresponding reference in new version: {1} (different version).\n\
  The version will be changed to the previously established version {2} for the module.

# New reference Version found in new Version, original was switched, and new
# version is as established.
# Arguments:
# - Original reference
# - New reference
# - Established Version (same as in new reference)
NEW_REFERENCE_VERSION_ORG_SWITCHED_NEW_SAME_AS_ESTABLISHED=\
  Original reference: {0} (switched to {2}).\n\
  Corresponding reference in new version: {1} (different version from original, but same as established for module).\n\
  The new established version will be kept for this reference.

# New reference Version found in new Version, original switched, and new
# version is different.
# Arguments:
# - Original reference
# - New reference
# - Established Version
NEW_REFERENCE_VERSION_ORG_SWITCHED=\
  Original reference: {0} (switched to {2}).\n\
  Corresponding reference in new version: {1} (different version).\n\
  The version will be changed to the established version {2} for the module.

# Reference in original Version corresponding to reference in new Version not
# found.
# Arguments:
# - New reference
REFERENCE_IN_ORG_VERSION_NOT_FOUND=\
  New reference: {0}\n\
  No corresponding reference found in original version. It will therefore be visited.

# No references in the differences were found.
# Arguments: none.
NO_REFERENCE_DIFFERENCES=No differences in the references were found.

# Reference changed and needs updating in parent.
# Arguments:
# - ReferencePath of parent
# - Reference to child
# - New dynamic Version
PARENT_WILL_BE_UPDATED_BECAUSE_REFERENCE_CHANGED=The version of reference {1} within ReferencePath {0} was established at {2} during its visit. We must update the parent.

# Reference Version was changed in parent.
# This message may seem redundant with
# PARENT_WILL_BE_UPDATED_BECAUSE_REFERENCE_CHANGED. This one occurs after the
# change and is also included in the list of significant actions performed,
# whereas the other one occurs before the change and is followed by a
# confirmation from the user.
# Arguments:
# - ReferencePath of parent
# - Reference to child
# - New Version
CHANGE_REFERENCE_VERSION=The version of reference {1} within ReferencePath {0} was changed to the version equivalent to {2} within the parent.

# Reference Version changed but no update required in parent.
# This can occur when references are expressed using ArtifactVersion's and the
# ArtifactVersion corresponding to the new Version is equivalent to the previous
# ArtifactVersion, such as with the "phase" new dynamic Version strategy.
# Arguments:
# - ReferencePath of parent
# - Reference to child
# - New Version
CHANGE_REFERENCE_VERSION_NO_ARTIFACT_VERSION_CHANGE=The version of reference {1} within ReferencePath {0} established at {2} is equivalent to the previous version within the parent (at the ArtifactVersion level). No change was performed.

# References were updated within parent following their switch to a dynamic
# version.
# This message may seem redundant with
# PARENT_WILL_BE_UPDATED_BECAUSE_REFERENCE_CHANGED. This one is used for the
# commit message.
# Arguments:
# - ReferencePath of parent
REFERENCES_UPDATED=One or more references within ReferencePath {0} were updated following their switch to a dynamic version.

# Existing dynamic ModuleVersion is to be kept. ArtifactVersion may need to be
# adjusted.
# Arguments:
# - ModuleVersion
DYNAMIC_MODULE_VERSION_KEPT=Dynamic ModuleVersion {0} is to be kept. The ArtifactVersion will simply be adjusted if required.

# ModuleVersion will be switched.
# Arguments:
# - ModuleVersion
# - New dynamic Version
MODULE_VERSION_WILL_BE_SWITCHED=ModuleVersion {0} will be switched to dynamic version {1}.

# ModuleVersion is already checked out in user workspace directory and changes
# will be performed in this directory.
# Arguments:
# - ModuleVersion
# - User workspace directory
MODULE_VERSION_CHECKED_OUT_IN_USER_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY=ModuleVersion {0} is already checked out in {1}. Changes will be performed in this directory.

# New dynamic Version does not exist and will be created based on another
# Version.
# Arguments:
# - ModuleVersion (original)
# - New dynamic Version
# - Base Version
NEW_DYNAMIC_VERSION_DOES_NOT_EXIST=New dynamic version {1} of ModuleVersion {0} does not exist and will be created based on version {2}.

# New dynamic Version was created based on another Version and was switched to.
# This message may seem redundant with NEW_DYNAMIC_VERSION_DOES_NOT_EXIST. This
# one occurs after the change and is also included in the list of significant
# actions performed, whereas the other one occurs before the change and is
# followed by a confirmation from the user.
# Arguments:
# - ModuleVersion (original)
# - New dynamic Version
# - Base Version
NEW_DYNAMIC_VERSION_CREATED_AND_SWITCHED=ModuleVersion {0} was switched to the base version {2} and a new version {1} was created based on it and was switched to.

# New dynamic Version was switched to.
# This message may seem redundant with NEW_DYNAMIC_VERSION_CREATED_AND_SWITCHED. This one
# occurs after the change and is also included in the list of significant actions
# performed, whereas the other one occurs before the change and is followed by a
# confirmation from the user.
# - ModuleVersion
# - New dynamic Version
NEW_DYNAMIC_VERSION_SWITCHED=ModuleVersion {0} was switched to the new version {1}.

# New dynamic Version was created based on another Version. This message is
# similar to NEW_DYNAMIC_VERSION_CREATED_AND_SWITCHED but since the change was
# performed in a system directory no switch was performed.
# Arguments:
# - ModuleVersion (original)
# - New dynamic Version
# - Base Version
NEW_DYNAMIC_VERSION_CREATED=New version {1} of ModuleVersion {0} was created based on version {2}.

# ArtifactVersion changed.
# Arguments:
# - Module
# - New Version
# - Previous ArtifactVersion
# - New ArtifactVersion
ARTIFACT_VERSION_CHANGED=Artifact version within module {0} has been updated to {3} from {2} following the creation of, the switch to or the reuse of the dynamic version {1}.
